    "- Chapters 9 to 12 go beyond NLP, and explore how Transformer models can be used tackle tasks in speech processing and computer vision. Along the way, you‚Äôll learn how to build and share demos of your models, and optimize them for production environments. By the end of this part, you will be ready to apply ü§ó Transformers to (almost) any machine learning problem!\n",

    "## [Natural Language Processing](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/2?fw=pt)\n",
    "Before jumping into Transformer models, let‚Äôs do a quick overview of what natural language processing is and why we care about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:\n",
    "- Classifying whole sentences: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not\n",
    "- Classifying each word in a sentence: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)\n",
    "- Generating text content: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\n",
    "- Extracting an answer from a text: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\n",
    "- Generating a new sentence from an input text: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP isn‚Äôt limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it challenging?\n",
    "Computers don‚Äôt process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence ‚ÄúI am hungry,‚Äù we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as ‚ÄúI am hungry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am sad,‚Äù we‚Äôre able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Transformers, what can they do?](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=pt)\n",
    "In this section, we will look at what Transformer models can do and use our first tool from the ü§ó Transformers library: the `pipeline()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers are everywhere!\n",
    "Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones mentioned in the previous section. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/organizations.png\">\n",
    "The ü§ó Transformers library provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The Model Hub contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub!\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è The Hugging Face Hub is not limited to Transformer models. Anyone can share any kind of models or datasets they want! [Create a huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join) account to benefit from all available features!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into how Transformer models work under the hood, let‚Äôs look at a few examples of how they can be used to solve some interesting NLP problems.\n",

    "We‚Äôll start by tackling a more challenging task where we need to classify texts that haven‚Äôt been labelled. This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don‚Äôt have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You‚Äôve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels ‚Äî but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."
