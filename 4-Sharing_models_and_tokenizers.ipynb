    "The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) – our main website – is a central platform that enables anyone to discover, use, and contribute new state-of-the-art models and datasets. It hosts a wide variety of models, with more than 10,000 publicly available. We'll focus on the models in this chapter, and take a look at the datasets in Chapter 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models in the Hub are not limited to 🤗 Transformers or even NLP. There are models from [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) and [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) for NLP, [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid) and [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speech, and [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) for vision, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these models is hosted as a Git repository, which allows versioning and reproducibility. Sharing a model on the Hub means opening it up to the community and making it accessible to anyone looking to easily use it, in turn eliminating their need to train a model on their own and simplifying sharing and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sharing a model on the Hub automatically deploys a hosted Inference API for that model. Anyone in the community is free to test it out directly on the model's page, with custom inputs and appropriate widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part is that sharing and using any public model on the Hub is completely free! [Paid plans](https://huggingface.co/pricing) also exist if you wish to share models privately.\n",

If you choose an organization, the model will be featured on the organization's page and every member of the organization will have the ability to contribute to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, enter your model's name. This will also be the name of the repository. Finally, you can specify whether you want your model to be public or private. Private models are hidden from public view.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating your model repository, you should see a page like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"sections/section_4/images/lysandre_dummy.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where your model will be hosted. To start populating it, you can add a README file directly from the web interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you look at the \"Files and versions\" tab, you'll see that there aren't many files there yet — just the *README.md* you just created and the *.gitattributes* file that keeps track of large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"sections/section_4/images/model_git.png\" width=\"75%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uploading the model files\n",
    "The system to manage files on the Hugging Face Hub is based on git for regular files, and git-lfs (which stands for [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)) for larger files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we go over three different ways of uploading files to the Hub: through `huggingface_hub` and through git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `upload_file` approach\n",
    "Using `upload_file` does not require git and git-lfs to be installed on your system. It pushes files directly to the 🤗 Hub using HTTP POST requests. A limitation of this approach is that it doesn't handle files that are larger than 5GB in size. If your files are larger than 5GB, please follow the two other methods detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API may be used as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "upload_file(\n",
    "    \"<path_to_file>/config.json\",\n",
    "    path_in_repo=\"config.json\",\n",
    "    repo_id=\"<namespace>/dummy-model\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will upload the file `config.json` available at `<path_to_file>` to the root of the repository as `config.json`, to the `dummy-model` repository. Other arguments which may be useful are:\n",
    "- `token`, if you would like to override the token stored in your cache by a given token.\n",
    "- `repo_type`, if you would like to upload to a `dataset` or a `space` instead of a model. Accepted values are `\"dataset\"` and `\"space\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `Repository` class\n",
    "The `Repository` class manages a local repository in a git-like manner. It abstracts most of the pain points one may have with git to provide all features that we require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this class requires having git and git-lfs installed, so make sure you have git-lfs installed (see [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation instructions) and set up before you begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start playing around with the repository we have just created, we can start by initialising it into a local folder by cloning the remote repository:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from huggingface_hub import Repository\n",
    "repo = Repository(\"<path_to_dummy_folder>\", clone_from=\"<namespace>/dummy-model\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates the folder `<path_to_dummy_folder>` in our working directory. This folder only contains the `.gitattributes` file as that's the only file created when instantiating the repository through `create_repo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on, we may leverage several of the traditional git methods:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "repo.git_pull()\n",
    "repo.git_add()\n",
    "repo.git_commit()\n",
    "repo.git_push()\n",
    "repo.git_tag()\n",
    "```\n",
    "And others! We recommend taking a look at the `Repository` documentation available [here](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/src/huggingface_hub#advanced-programmatic-repository-management) for an overview of all available methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, we have a model and a tokenizer that we would like to push to the hub. We have successfully cloned the repository, we can therefore save the files within that repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first make sure that our local clone is up to date by pulling the latest changes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "repo.git_pull()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once that is done, we save the model and tokenizer files:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.save_pretrained(\"<path_to_dummy_folder>\")\n",
    "tokenizer.save_pretrained(\"<path_to_dummy_folder>\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `<path_to_dummy_folder>` now contains all the model and tokenizer files. We follow the usual git workflow by adding files to the staging area, committing them and pushing them to the hub:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "repo.git_add()\n",
    "repo.git_commit(\"Add model and tokenizer files\")\n",
    "repo.git_push()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Congratulations! You just pushed your first files on the hub (not).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The git-based approach\n",
    "This is the very barebones approach to uploading files: we'll do so with git and git-lfs directly. Most of the difficulty is abstracted away by previous approaches, but there are a few caveats with the following method so we'll follow a more complex use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this class requires having git and git-lfs installed, so make sure you have git-lfs installed (see [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation instructions) and set up before you begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "First start by initializing git-lfs:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git lfs install\n",
    "\n",
    "Updated git hooks.\n",
    "Git LFS initialized.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once that's done, the first step is to clone your model repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://huggingface.co/<namespace>/<your-model-id>\n",
    "```\n",
    "My username is `lysandre` and I've used the model name `dummy`, so for me the command ends up looking like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://huggingface.co/lysandre/dummy\n",
    "```\n",
    "I now have a folder named `dummy` in my working directory. I can `cd` into the folder and have a look at the contents:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd dummy && ls\n",
    "\n",

    "## [Building a model card](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter4/4?fw=pt)\n",
    "The model card is a file which is arguably as important as the model and tokenizer files in a model repository. It is the central definition of the model, ensuring reusability by fellow community members and reproducibility of results, and providing a platform on which other members may build their artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documenting the training and evaluation process helps others understand what to expect of a model – and providing sufficient information regarding the data that was used and the preprocessing and postprocessing that were done ensures that the limitations, biases, and contexts in which the model is and is not useful can be identified and understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, creating a model card that clearly defines your model is a very important step. Here, we provide some tips that will help you with this. Creating the model card is done through the *README.md* file you saw earlier, which is a Markdown file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"model card\" concept originates from a research direction from Google, first shared in the paper [\"Model Cards for Model Reporting\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) by Margaret Mitchell et al. A lot of information contained here is based on that paper, and we recommend you take a look at it to understand why model cards are so important in a world that values reproducibility, reusability, and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model card usually starts with a very brief, high-level overview of what the model is for, followed by additional details in the following sections:\n",
    "- Model description\n",
    "- Intended uses & limitations\n",
    "- How to use\n",
    "- Limitations and bias\n",
    "- Training data\n",
    "- Training procedure\n",
    "- Evaluation results\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what each of these sections should contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model description\n",
    "The model description provides basic details about the model. This includes the architecture, version, if it was introduced in a paper, if an original implementation is available, the author, and general information about the model. Any copyright should be attributed here. General information about training procedures, parameters, and important disclaimers can also be mentioned in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intended uses & limitations\n",
    "Here, you describe the use cases the model is intended for, including the languages, fields, and domains where it can be applied. This section of the model card can also document areas that are known to be out of scope for the model, or where it is likely to perform suboptimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use\n",
    "This section should include some examples of how to use the model. This can showcase usage of the `pipeline()` function, usage of the model and tokenizer classes, and any other code you think might be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training data\n",
    "This part should indicate which dataset(s) the model was trained on. A brief description of the dataset(s) is also welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training procedure\n",
    "In this section you should describe all the relevant aspects of training that are useful from a reproducibility perspective. This includes any preprocessing and postprocessing that were done on the data, as well as details such as the number of epochs the model was trained for, the batch size, the learning rate, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable and metrics\n",
    "Here you should describe the metrics you use for evaluation, and the different factors you are mesuring. Mentioning which metric(s) were used, on which dataset and which dataset split, makes it easy to compare you model's performance compared to that of other models. These should be informed by the previous sections, such as the intended users and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation results\n",
    "Finally, provide an indication of how well the model performs on the evaluation dataset. If the model uses a decision threshold, either provide the decision threshold used in the evaluation, or provide details on evaluation at different thresholds for the intended uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Check out the following for a few examples of well-crafted model cards:\n",
    "- [bert-base-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased)\n",
    "- [gpt2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)\n",
    "- [distilbert](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)\n",
    "\n",
    "More examples from different organizations and companies are available [here](https://github.com/huggingface/model_card/blob/master/examples.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "Model cards are not a requirement when publishing models, and you don't need to include all of the sections described above when you make one. However, explicit documentation of the model can only benefit future users, so we recommend that you fill in as many of the sections as possible to the best of your knowledge and ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model card metadata\n",
    "If you have done a little exploring of the Hugging Face Hub, you should have seen that some models belong to certain categories: you can filter them by tasks, languages, libraries, and more. The categories a model belongs to are identified according to the metadata you add in the model card header.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you take a look at the [`camembert-base` model card](https://huggingface.co/camembert-base/blob/main/README.md), you should see the following lines in the model card header:\n",
    "```\n",
    "language: fr\n",
    "license: mit\n",
    "datasets:\n",
    "- oscar\n",
    "```\n",
    "This metadata is parsed by the Hugging Face Hub, which then identifies this model as being a French model, with an MIT license, trained on the Oscar dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [full model card specification](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blame/main/modelcard.md) allows specifying languages, licenses, tags, datasets, metrics, as well as the evaluation results the model obtained when training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Part 1 completed!](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter4/5?fw=pt)\n",
    "This is the end of the first part of the course! Part 2 will be released on November 15th with a big community event, see more information [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/course-launch-event).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to fine-tune a pretrained model on a text classification problem (single or pairs of sentences) and upload the result to the Model Hub. To make sure you mastered this first section, you should do exactly that on a problem that interests you (and not necessarily in English if you speak another language)! You can find help in the [Hugging Face forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) and share your project in [this topic](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/share-your-projects/6803) once you're finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't wait to see what you will build with this!\n",
    "\n",
    "## [End-of-chapter quiz](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter4/6?fw=pt)\n",
    "Let's test what you learned in this chapter!\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What are models on the Hub limited to?**<br>\n",
    "⚪️ Models from the 🤗 Transformers library.<br>\n",
    "⚪️ All models with a similar interface to 🤗 Transformers.<br>\n",
    "⚫️ There are no limits.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Right! There are no limits when uploading models to the Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚪️ Models that are in some way related to NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How can you manage models on the Hub?**<br>\n",
    "⚪️ Through a GCP account.<br>\n",
    "⚪️ Through peer-to-peer distribution.<br>\n",
    "⚫️ Through git and git-lfs.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! Models on the Hub are simple Git repositories, leveraging git-lfs for large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What can you do using the Hugging Face Hub web interface?**<br>\n",
    "⚪️ Fork an existing repository.<br>\n",
    "⚫️ Create a new model repository.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! That's not all you can do, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ Manage and edit files.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! That's not the only right answer, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ Upload files.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Right! But that's not all.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ See diffs across versions.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! That's not all you can do, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is a model card?**<br>\n",
    "⚪️ A rough description of the model, therefore less important than the model and tokenizer files.<br>\n",
    "⚫️ A way to ensure reproducibility, reusability, and fairness.<br>\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! Sharing the right information in the model card will help users leverage your model and be aware of its limits and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚪️ A Python file that can be run to retrieve information about the model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Which of these objects of the 🤗 Transformers library can be directly shared on the Hub with `push_to_hub()`?**<br>\n",
    "⚫️ A tokenizer\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! All tokenizers have the `push_to_hub` method, and using it will push all the tokenizer files (vocabulary, architecture of the tokenizer, etc.) to a given repo. That's not the only right answer, though!\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ A model configuration\n",
    "> **Correct!** Right! All model configurations have the `push_to_hub` method, and using it will push them to a given repo. What else can you share?\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ A model\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct! All models have the `push_to_hub` method, and using it will push them and their configuration files to a given repo. That's not all you can share, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ A Trainer\n",
    "> **Correct!** That's right — the `Trainer` also implements the `push_to_hub` method, and using it will upload the model, its configuration, the tokenizer, and a model card draft to a given repo. Try another answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is the first step when using the `push_to_hub()` method or the CLI tools?**<br>\n",
    "⚪️ Log in on the website.<br>\n",
    "⚫️ Run 'huggingface-cli login' in a terminal.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct — this will download and cache your personal token.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ Run 'notebook_login()' in a notebook.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct — this will display a widget to let you authenticate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. You're using a model and a tokenizer — how can you upload them to the Hub?**<br>\n",
    "⚫️ By calling the `push_to_hub` method directly on the model and the tokenizer.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "⚪️ Within the Python runtime, by wrapping them in a `huggingface_hub` utility.<br>\n",
    "⚪️ By saving them to disk and calling `transformers-cli upload-model`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Which git operations can you do with the `Repository` class?**<br>\n",
    "⚫️ A commit.\n",
    "> **Correct!** Correct, the `git_commit()` method is there for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ A pull.\n",
    "> **Correct!** That is the purpose of the `git_pull()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚫️ A push.\n",
    "> **Correct!** The method `git_push()` does this.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚪️ A merge."
