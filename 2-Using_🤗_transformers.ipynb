    "# Using ü§ó transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Introduction](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2/1?fw=pt)\n",
    "As you saw in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1), Transformer models are usually very large. With millions to tens of *billions* of parameters, training and deploying these models is a complicated undertaking. Furthermore, with new models being released on a near-daily basis and each having its own implementation, trying them all out is no easy task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ü§ó Transformers library was created to solve this problem. Its goal is to provide a single API through which any Transformer model can be loaded, trained, and saved. The library‚Äôs main features are:\n",
    "- **Ease of use**: Downloading, loading, and using a state-of-the-art NLP model for inference can be done in just two lines of code.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: At their core, all models are simple PyTorch `nn.Module` or TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model` classes and can be handled like any other models in their respective machine learning (ML) frameworks.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Hardly any abstractions are made across the library. The \"All in one file\" is a core concept: a model's forward pass is entirely defined in a single file, so that the code itself is understandable and hackable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last feature makes ü§ó Transformers quite different from other ML libraries. The models are not built on modules that are shared across files; instead, each model has its own layers. In addition to making the models more approachable and understandable, this allows you to easily experiment on one model without affecting others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will begin with an end-to-end example where we use a model and a tokenizer together to replicate the `pipeline()` function introduced in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1). Next, we‚Äôll discuss the model API: we‚Äôll dive into the model and configuration classes, and show you how to load a model and how it processes numerical inputs to output predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we‚Äôll look at the tokenizer API, which is the other main component of the `pipeline()` function. Tokenizers take care of the first and last processing steps, handling the conversion from text to numerical inputs for the neural network, and the conversion back to text when it is needed. Finally, we‚Äôll show you how to handle sending multiple sentences through a model in a prepared batch, then wrap it all up with a closer look at the high-level `tokenizer()` function.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing with a tokenizer\n",
    "Like other neural networks, Transformer models can't process raw text directly, so the first step of our pipeline is to convert the text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a *tokenizer*, which will be responsible for:\n",
    "- Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called tokens.\n",
    "- Mapping each token to an integer.\n",
    "- Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model.\n",

    "All this preprocessing needs to be done in exactly the same way as when the model was pretrained, so we first need to download that information from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

For example, there are over 500.000 words in the English language, so to build a map from each word to an input ID we'd need to keep track of that many IDs. Furthermore, words like \"dog\" are represented differently from words like \"dogs\", and the model will initially have no way of knowing that \"dog\" and \"dogs\" are similar: it will identify the two words as unrelated. The same applies to other similar words, like \"run\" and \"running\", which the model will not see as being similar initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need a custom token to represent words that are not in our vocabulary. This is known as the \"unknown\" token, often represented as `\"[UNK]\"` or `\"\"`. It‚Äôs generally a bad sign if you see that the tokenizer is producing a lot of these tokens, as it wasn't able to retrieve a sensible representation of a word and you're losing information along the way. The goal when crafting the vocabulary is to do it in such a way that the tokenizer tokenizes as few words as possible into the unknown token.\n",
