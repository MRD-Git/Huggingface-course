    "# The ü§ó tokenizers library\n",
    "## [Introduction](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/1?fw=pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Chapter 3](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter3), we looked at how to fine-tune a model on a given task. When we do that, we use the same tokenizer that the model was pretrained with ‚Äî but what do we do when we want to train a model from scratch? In these cases, using a tokenizer that was pretrained on a corpus from another domain or language is typically suboptimal. For example, a tokenizer that's trained on an English corpus will perform poorly on a corpus of Japanese texts because the use of spaces and punctuation is very different in the two languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn how to train a brand new tokenizer on a corpus of texts, so it can then be used to pretrain a language model. This will all be done with the help of the [ü§ó Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library, which provides the \"fast\" tokenizers in the [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library. We'll take a close look at the features that this library provides, and explore how the fast tokenizers differ from the \"slow\" versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics we will cover include:\n",
    "- How to train a new tokenizer similar to the one used by a given checkpoint on a new corpus of texts.\n",
    "- The special features of fast tokenizers.\n",
    "- The differences between the three main subword tokenization algorithms used in NLP today.\n",
    "- How to build a tokenizer from scratch with the ü§ó Tokenizers library and train it on some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques introduced in this chapter will prepare you for the section in [Chapter 7](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6) where we look at creating a language model for Python source code. Let's start by looking at what it means to \"train\" a tokenizer in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Training a new tokenizer from an old one](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/2?fw=pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a language model is not available in the language you are interested in, or if your corpus is very different from the one your language model was trained on, you will most likely want to retrain the model from scratch using a tokenizer adapted to your data. That will require training a new tokenizer on your dataset. But what exactly does that mean? When we first looked at tokenizers in [Chapter 2](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2), we saw that most Transformer models use a *subword tokenization algorithm*. To identify which subwords are of interest and occur most frequently in the corpus at hand, the tokenizer needs to take a hard look at all the texts in the corpus ‚Äî a process we call *training*. The exact rules that govern this training depend on the type of tokenizer used, and we'll go over the three main algorithms later in this chapter."

    "> <font color=\"darkred\">‚ö†Ô∏è Training a tokenizer is not the same as training a model! Model training uses stochastic gradient descent to make the loss a little bit smaller for each batch. It's randomized by nature (meaning you have to set some seeds to get the same results when doing the same training twice). Training a tokenizer is a statistical process that tries to identify which subwords are the best to pick for a given corpus, and the exact rules used to pick them depend on the tokenization algorithm. It's deterministic, meaning you always get the same results when training with the same algorithm on the same corpus.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assembling a corpus\n",
    "There's a very simple API in ü§ó Transformers that you can use to train a new tokenizer with the same characteristics as an existing one: `AutoTokenizer.train_new_from_iterator()`. To see this in action, let's say we want to train GPT-2 from scratch, but in a language other than English. Our first task will be to gather lots of data in that language in a training corpus. To provide examples everyone will be able to understand, we won't use a language like Russian or Chinese here, but rather a specialized English language: Python code.\n",
    "\n",

We'll use the usual `load_dataset()` function to download and cache the [CodeSearchNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/code_search_net) dataset. This dataset was created for the [CodeSearchNet challenge](https://wandb.ai/github/CodeSearchNet/benchmark) and contains millions of functions from open source libraries on GitHub in several programming languages.

    "Note that `AutoTokenizer.train_new_from_iterator()` only works if the tokenizer you are using is a \"fast\" tokenizer. As you'll see in the next section, the ü§ó Transformers library contains two types of tokenizers: some are written purely in Python and others (the fast ones) are backed by the ü§ó Tokenizers library, which is written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. Python is the language most often used for data science and deep learning applications, but when anything needs to be parallelized to be fast, it has to be written in another language. For instance, the matrix multiplications that are at the core of the model computation are written in CUDA, an optimized C library for GPUs.\n",

    "Training a brand new tokenizer in pure Python would be excruciatingly slow, which is why we developed the ü§ó Tokenizers library. Note that just as you didn't have to learn the CUDA language to be able to execute your model on a batch of inputs on a GPU, you won't need to learn Rust to use a fast tokenizer. The ü§ó Tokenizers library provides Python bindings for many methods that internally call some piece of code in Rust; for example, to parallelize the training of your new tokenizer or, as we saw in [Chapter 3](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter3), the tokenization of a batch of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the Transformer models have a fast tokenizer available (there are some exceptions that you can check [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/#supported-frameworks)), and the `AutoTokenizer` API always selects the fast tokenizer for you if it's available. In the next section we'll take a look at some of the other special features fast tokenizers have, which will be really useful for tasks like token classification and question answering. Before diving into that, however, let's try our brand new tokenizer on the previous example:"

    "We can see that the tokenizer's special tokens `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` are mapped to `None`, and then each token is mapped to the word it originates from. This is especially useful to determine if a token is at the start of a word or if two tokens are in the same word. We could rely on the `##` prefix for that, but it only works for BERT-like tokenizers; this method works for any type of tokenizer as long as it's a fast one. In the next chapter, we'll see how we can use this capability to apply the labels we have for each word properly to the tokens in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. We can also use it to mask all the tokens coming from the same word in masked language modeling (a technique called *whole word masking*).\n",
