    "## [Natural language processing](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/2?fw=pt)\n",
    "Before jumping into Transformer models, let‚Äôs do a quick overview of what natural language processing is and why we care about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:\n",
    "- Classifying whole sentences: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not\n",
    "- Classifying each word in a sentence: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)\n",
    "- Generating text content: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\n",
    "- Extracting an answer from a text: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\n",
    "- Generating a new sentence from an input text: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP isn‚Äôt limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it challenging?\n",
    "Computers don‚Äôt process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence ‚ÄúI am hungry,‚Äù we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as ‚ÄúI am hungry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am sad,‚Äù we‚Äôre able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Transformers, what can they do?](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=pt)\n",
    "In this section, we will look at what Transformer models can do and use our first tool from the ü§ó Transformers library: the `pipeline()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers are everywhere!\n",
    "Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones mentioned in the previous section. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/organizations.png\">\n",
    "The ü§ó Transformers library provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The Model Hub contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub!\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è The Hugging Face Hub is not limited to Transformer models. Anyone can share any kind of models or datasets they want! [Create a huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join) account to benefit from all available features!\n",
    "\n",

    "We‚Äôll start by tackling a more challenging task where we need to classify texts that haven‚Äôt been labelled. This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don‚Äôt have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You‚Äôve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels ‚Äî but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."

    "### A bit of Transformer history\n",
    "Here are some reference points in the (short) history of Transformer models:\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/transformers_chrono.svg\">\n",
    "The [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) was introduced in June 2017. The focus of the original research was on translation tasks. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:\n",
    "- **June 2018**: [GPT](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf), the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results\n",
    "- **October 2018**: [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)\n",
    "- **February 2019**: [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",
    "- **October 2019**: [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT‚Äôs performance\n",
    "- **October 2019**: [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) and [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), two large pretrained models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so)\n",
    "- **May 2020**, [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called *zero-shot learning*)\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is far from comprehensive, and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into three categories:\n",
    "- GPT-like (also called *auto-regressive* Transformer models)\n",
    "- BERT-like (also called *auto-encoding* Transformer models)\n",
    "- BART/T5-like (also called *sequence-to-sequence* Transformer models)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive into these families in more depth later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers are language models\n",
    "All the Transformer models mentioned above (GPT, BERT, BART, T5, etc.) have been trained as *language models*. This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it‚Äôs not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called *transfer learning*. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way ‚Äî that is, using human-annotated labels ‚Äî on a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a task is predicting the next word in a sentence having read the *n* previous words. This is called *causal language modeling* because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones.\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/causal_modeling.svg\">\n",
    "Another example is *masked language modeling*, in which the model predicts a masked word in the sentence.\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/masked_modeling.svg\">\n",
    "### Transformers are big models\n",
    "Apart from a few outliers (like DistilBERT), the general strategy to achieve better performance is by increasing the models' sizes as well as the amount of data they are pretrained on.\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/big_models.png\">\n",
    "Unfortunately, training a model, especially a large one, requires a large amount of data. This becomes very costly in terms of time and compute resources. It even translates to environmental impact, as can be seen in the following graph.\n",

    "This pretraining is usually done on very large amounts of data. Therefore, it requires a very large corpus of data, and training can take up to several weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fine-tuning*, on the other hand, is the training done **after** a model has been pretrained. To perform fine-tuning, you first acquire a pretrained language model, then perform additional training with a dataset specific to your task. Wait ‚Äî why not simply train directly for the final task? There are a couple of reasons:\n",
    "- The pretrained model was already trained on a dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset. The fine-tuning process is thus able to take advantage of knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task).\n",
    "- Since the pretrained model was already trained on lots of data, the fine-tuning requires way less data to get decent results.\n",
    "- For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is \"transferred\", hence the term *transfer learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float=center;\" src=\"images/finetuning.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a model therefore has lower time, data, financial, and environmental costs. It is also quicker and easier to iterate over different fine-tuning schemes, as the training is less constraining than a full pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a pretrained model ‚Äî one as close as possible to the task you have at hand ‚Äî and fine-tune it.\n",
