    "## [Training a causal language model from scratch](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6?fw=pt)\n",
    "Up until now, we've mostly been using pretrained models and fine-tuning them for new use cases by reusing the weights from pretraining. As we saw in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1), this is commonly referred to as *transfer learning*, and it's a very successful strategy for applying Transformer models to most real-world use cases where labeled data is sparse. In this chapter, we'll take a different approach and train a completely new model from scratch. This is a good approach to take if you have a lot of data and it is very different from the pretraining data used for the available models. However, it also requires considerably more compute resources to pretrain a language model than just to fine-tune an existing one. Examples where it can make sense to train a new model include for datasets consisting of musical notes, molecular sequences such as DNA, or programming languages. The latter have recently gained traction thanks to tools such as TabNine and GitHub's Copilot, powered by OpenAI's Codex model, that can generate long sequences of code. This task of text generation is best addressed with auto-regressive or causal language models such as GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will build a scaled-down version of a code generation model: we'll focus on one-line completions instead of full functions or classes, using a subset of Python code. When working with data in Python you are in frequent contact with the Python data science stack, consisting of the `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` libraries. When using those frameworks it's common to need to look up specific commands, so it would be nice if we could use a model to complete these calls for us."

If it is important for your application to have more context (for example, if you want the model to write unit tests based on a file with the function definition), make sure you increase that number, but also keep in mind that this comes with a greater GPU memory footprint. For now, let's fix the context size at 128 tokens, as opposed to the 1024 or 2048 used in GPT-2 or GPT-3, respectively.\n",

We can achieve this by starting the labels from the second token of the input sequence, since the model does not make a prediction for the first token anyway. Then we cut off the last logit, as we don't have a label for the token that follows the full input sequence. With that we can compute the loss per sample and count the occurrences of all keywords in each sample. Finally, we calculate the weighted average over all samples using the occurrences as weights.

    "Those are very high values for loss and perplexity, but that's not surprising as we haven't trained the model yet. With that, we have everything prepared to write the core part of the training script: the training loop. In the training loop we iterate over the dataloader and pass the batches to the model. With the logits, we can then evaluate our custom loss function. We scale the loss by the number of gradient accumulation steps so as not to create larger losses when aggregating more steps. Before we optimize, we also clip the gradients for better convergence. Finally, every few steps we evaluate the model on the evaluation set with our new `evaluate()` function:"
