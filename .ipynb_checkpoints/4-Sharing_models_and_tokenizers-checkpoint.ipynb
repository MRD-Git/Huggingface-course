    "The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) – our main website – is a central platform that enables anyone to discover, use, and contribute new state-of-the-art models and datasets. It hosts a wide variety of models, with more than 10,000 publicly available. We'll focus on the models in this chapter, and take a look at the datasets in Chapter 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models in the Hub are not limited to 🤗 Transformers or even NLP. There are models from [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) and [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) for NLP, [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid) and [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speech, and [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) for vision, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these models is hosted as a Git repository, which allows versioning and reproducibility. Sharing a model on the Hub means opening it up to the community and making it accessible to anyone looking to easily use it, in turn eliminating their need to train a model on their own and simplifying sharing and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sharing a model on the Hub automatically deploys a hosted Inference API for that model. Anyone in the community is free to test it out directly on the model's page, with custom inputs and appropriate widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part is that sharing and using any public model on the Hub is completely free! [Paid plans](https://huggingface.co/pricing) also exist if you wish to share models privately.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the `push_to_hub()` method accepts several arguments, making it possible to upload to a specific repository or organization namespace, or to use a different API token. We recommend you take a look at the method specification available directly in the [🤗 Transformers documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_sharing.html) to get an idea of what is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `push_to_hub()` method is backed by the [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) Python package, which offers a direct API to the Hugging Face Hub. It's integrated within 🤗 Transformers and several other machine learning libraries, like [`allenlp`](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp). Although we focus on the 🤗 Transformers integration in this chapter, integrating it into your own code or library is simple.\n",
