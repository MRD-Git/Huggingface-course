This can save a lot of time and processing power when the inputs have very variable lengths!\n",

    "The function that is responsible for putting together samples inside a batch is called a *collate function*. It’s an argument you can pass when you build a `DataLoader`, the default being a function that will just convert your samples to PyTorch tensors and concatenate them (recursively if your elements are lists, tuples, or dictionaries). This won’t be possible in our case since the inputs we have won’t all be of the same size. We have deliberately postponed the padding, to only apply it as necessary on each batch and avoid having over-long inputs with a lot of padding. This will speed up training by quite a bit, but note that if you’re training on a TPU it can cause problems — TPUs prefer fixed shapes, even when that requires extra padding.\n",
